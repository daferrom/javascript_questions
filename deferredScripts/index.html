<h1>The script defer attribute</h1>


<p>The script above requests information from the paragraph below. Normally, this is not possible, because the script is executed before the paragraph exists.</p>

<p id="p1">Hello World!</p>

<p>However, the defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed later. This way the script can request information from the paragraph.</p>
